- **Live Data**: Opportunities are fetched in real-time from GitHub Jobs (Issues) and Hacker News. No fake data.
- **Verified Listings**: All opportunities include verified links and company logos (via Clearbit API).
- **Profile Editing**: Users can customize their identity with a display name and profile picture (via `Dashboard` or header).
